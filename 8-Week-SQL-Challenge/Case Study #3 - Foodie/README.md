## Introduction
Danny wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!


Danny's startup Foodie-Fi lanched in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!


This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.


## Problem Statement
### Available Data
Danny has shared the data design for Foodie-Fi and also short descriptions on each of the database tables

All datasets exist within the foodie_fi database schema.

Danny has shared with us 2 key tables for this case study:
- plans: The table shows the plans which customers choose
- subscriptions: Customer subscriptions show the exact date where their specific plan_id starts.

## Case Study Questions
This case study has lots of questions but I will only focus on **Part B: Data Analysis Questions.**


### B. Data Analysis Questions
1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?
