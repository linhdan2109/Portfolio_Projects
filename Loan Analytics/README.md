# Loan Analysis Project

## Introduction
**About Lending Club company**

LendingClub is a financial services company. LendingClub enabled borrowers to create unsecured personal loans between 1,000 USD and 40,000 USD. The standard loan period was three years. Lenders were able to browse the loan listings on LendingClub website and select loans that they wanted to lend in based on the information about the borrower, amount of loan, loan grade, and loan purpose. Lender made money from the interest on these loans. LendingClub made money by charging borrowers and lender a service fee.

## Business Understanding
A financial company like LendingClub can leverage data analysis and data science to make more informed lending decisions, enhance customer experience, mitigate risks, and improve overall operational efficiency. 

In this project, I will perform EDA to understand borrowers' characteristics such as demographics, behavior, and credit history. Data analysis can provide insights into macroeconomic trends, interest rate changes, and market conditions that impact lending activities. Futhermore, in the data analysis process, we can also identify suspicious patterns and anomalies in data that might indicate default of borrowers.

I also apply data science to build predictive models to assess the creditworthiness of applicants. These models analyze various factors such as income, loan amount, credit history, and other relevant data to predict the likelihood of default.

## Data Understanding
The data contains the information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not, the time period is from 2007 to 2011.

The data has 111 atributes and 39717 observations. 

The data is not clean, so before doing data analysis tasks we have to clean the data first.

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves identifying and rectifying errors, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies present in the raw data. It ensures that the data used for analysis is accurate, reliable, and suitable for making informed decisions. I this process, I used R to clean the data.

You can see my Jupyter Notebook containing cleaning steps [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Loan%20Analytics/Data%20Cleaning%20process.ipynb#exportfile)

## Data Analysis
I will use SQl to perform loan data analysis. SQL is a versatile and efficient tool that empowers me to explore the data, extract valuable insights, and derive meaningful conclusions that will drive informed decision-making processes.

By crafting intricate SQL queries, I can delve into various aspects of the loan data, including borrower demographics, loan amounts, interest rates, repayment history, and more. Harnessing SQL's capabilities for loan data analysis will allow me to unlock the true potential of the data, providing actionable insights that drive smarter lending practices and contribute to the overall success of the lending company.
