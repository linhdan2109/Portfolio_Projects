# Welcome
This repository contains my personal portfolio projects to show off skills, who I am and What I am interested in.

# List of Projects
1. [Linear regression model](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Factors%20Influencing%20Infant%20health%20(Linear%20regression%20model)): Use R to build a Multiple Linear Regression Model to determine the effects of Independent Variables (faminc, male, cigs, cigtax, cigprice) on the baby on infant health (Dependent Variable). 
2. [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Google%20Data%20Analytics%20Professional%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project): This is the project I have done at the end of the Google Data Analytics Professional Course. 
3. [8 Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/8-Week-SQL-Challenge): This project contains my solutions for the  [8WeekSQLChallenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com/) case studies. The Challenge is created by Danny Ma through Data With Danny virtual data apprenticeship program, which consists of 8 different SQL challenges.
4. [Fraud Detection](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Fraud%20Detection): The objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. I will employ a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and k nearest neighbor. Through model training and evaluation, I will assess the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUPRC. This evaluation will enable us to identify the most effective model for fraud detection. Additionally, I will address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are typically a minority class.
