# List of Projects

## Machine learning

1. [Fraud Detection](https://nbviewer.org/github/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Fraud%20Detection/imbalanced-dataset-fraud-detection.ipynb): The objective of this project is to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques. I will employ a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forests, and k nearest neighbor. Through model training and evaluation, I will assess the performance of each algorithm in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score and AUPRC. This evaluation will enable us to identify the most effective model for fraud detection. Additionally, I will address the challenge of imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are typically a minority class.

2. [Promo Abuse Detection](https://nbviewer.org/github/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Promo%20Abuse%20Detection/Promo%20Abuse%20Detection.ipynb): This Promo Abuse Detection Project employs techniques to effectively tackle qualitative variables and build a robust model. The Multivariate Correspondence Analysis (MCA) technique is used to handle qualitative variables, while supervised learning techniques are applied to construct a predictive model. Among the various models explored, the Random Forest algorithm emerged as the most optimal choice for promo abuse detection.

3. [A GARCH volatility analysis](https://nbviewer.org/github/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/blob/87e84dfc7bf93579f5d3fcf624ae2da9db7f895c/A%20GARCH%20volatility%20analysis/BTC%20and%20S%26P500%20correlation.ipynb#datareview): This research investigates the hedging and diversification abilities of Bitcoin against the S&P500 and examines the leverage effect of Bitcoin return. This project uses symmetric GARCH model and asymmetric GARCH model like EGARCH and TGARCH (GJR) model. The results show that Bitcoin acts as a diversifier for investors in US market. In addition, the EGARCH and TGARCH models implied that there is leverage effect in Bitcoin return. Let's start our analysis.

## Statistic 

1. [Linear regression model](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Factors%20Influencing%20Infant%20health%20(Linear%20regression%20model)): Use R to build a Multiple Linear Regression Model and conduct lots of hypothesis testing: Residual Normality Test, Heteroskedasticity Test, T-test, F-test to remove insignificant variables and unnecessary variables.


## SQL
1. [Case Study #1: Danny's Diner](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/Case%20Study%20%231%20-%20Danny's%20Diner): Use SQL to extract the data to answer questions about the customers, their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite.

2. [Case Study #2: Pizza Runner](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/Case%20Study%20%232%20-%20Pizza%20Runner): Use SQL to clean the data and apply some basic calculations to optimise the store's operations.

3. [Case Study #3: Foodie-Fi](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/8-Week-SQL-Challenge/Case%20Study%20%233%20-%20Foodie): This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.


## End to End project
1. [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Capstone Project](https://github.com/linhdan2109/Portfolio_Projects/tree/main/Google%20Data%20Analytics%20Professional%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project): This is the project I have done at the end of the Google Data Analytics Professional Course. Following the data analysis process taught in the course, I effectively addressed key business questions. This process involved six essential steps: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act. By applying these steps, I was able to gain valuable insights and provide actionable recommendations to support Bellabeat's marketing strategies and decision-making processes.
