## Objective
Build a Regression model to determine the effects of smoking during pregnancy on infant health. I also take some other factors that affect birth weight and likely to be correlated with smoking into account. Consider the following model: 
-  bwght = β0 + β1 faminc + β2 male + β3 cigs + β4 cigtax + β5 cigprice + u

## Introduce Variables

### Dependent Variable
- bwght: birth weight, ounces

### Independent Variables
- faminc: family income, $1000s
- male: =1 if male child - Dummy Variable
- cigs:  cigs smoked per day while preg
- cigtax: cig. tax in home state
- cigprice:  cig. price in home state
  
### Source
Wooldridge Source: Use the data set BWGHT in libary (Wooldridge) to estimate the model.

## Skills Acquired
