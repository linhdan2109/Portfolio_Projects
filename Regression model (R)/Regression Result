Regression Result


1. With the model:  
      bwght = β0 + β1 faminc + β2 male + β3 cigs + β4 cigtax + β5 cigprice + u
      
- The OLS regression is
bwght = 114.8178 + 0.0963faminc + 3.0365male – 0.4666cigs + 0.1439cigtax – 0.0179cigprice      (1)
        (11.8974)   (0.0295)       (1.0769)    (0.0914)       (0.1442)	       (0.1102)      
		n = 1388,  R2 = 0.03788
 
 
2. Regression specification error test (RESET)
Let bwght^ denote the OLS fitted values from estimating (1). Use this equation to test whether (1) has missed important nonlinearities:
bwght = 114.8178 + 0.0963faminc + 3.0365male – 0.4666cigs + 0.1439cigtax – 0.0179cigprice + d1.(bwght^)^2 + d2.(bwght^)^3 + error    (2)
Hypothesis:
     H0: d1 = 0, d2 = 0 ( (1) is correctly specified )
     H1: H0 is not true 
The RESET statistic in (2) have p-value = 0.3759 > α=0.05  
Thus, we do not reject H0 at the 5% significance level
We can conclude that the model (1) was not rejected by RESET (at the 5% level)


3. Residual Normality Test (Jarque.Bera test and Shapiro.Wilk test)
Hypothesis:
     H0: residual is normally distributed
     H1: residual is not normally distributed
Result: 
    Jarque-Bera test for normality: p-value < 2.2e-16
    Shapiro-Wilk normality test: p-value = 1.37e-15  
Thus, we reject H0 at the 5% significance level. So, residual is not normally distributed
But because our dataset has a large sample size (1388 observations). 
=> the OLS estimators are normally distributed regardless of the population distribution of u (from Central limit theorem)
=> the T-test and the F-test are still valid


4.  Heteroskedasticity Test (Breusch-Pagan Test and White Test)
Hypothesis:
     H0: Homoskedasticity 
     H1: Heteroskedasticity
Result: 
    Breusch-Pagan test : p-value = 0.9762 > α=0.05
    White test: p-value = 0.6603 > α=0.05
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity (at the 5% level)


5. T-Test
Hypothesis:
     H0: βj = 0 (j = 1,2,3,4,5)
     H1: βj != 0 (j = 1,2,3,4,5)
Under this alternative, xj has a ceteris paribus effect on y without specifying whether the effect is positive or negative.
Result (at the 5% level):
  
  - faminc: 
  p-value = 0,00113 < α=0.05 => reject H0
  => faminc has a ceteris paribus effect on bwght
	
  - male: 
  p-value = 0,00448 < α=0.05 => reject H0
  => male has a ceteris paribus effect on bwght
	
  - cigs: 
  p-value = 3.72e^(-7)< α=0.05 =>  reject H0
  => cigs has a ceteris paribus effect on bwght
	
  - Biến cigtax: 
  p-value = 0,31827 > α=0.05 => Can't not reject H0
  => cigtax does not have a ceteris paribus effect on bwght
	
  - cigprice: 
  p-value = 0,87097 > α=0.05 => Bác bỏ giả thuyết Ho 
  => cigprice does not have a ceteris paribus effect on bwght


6. F-Test - LM Test
As the test results above, we see that cigtax and cigprice has no partial effect on bwght.
Now, we want to test whether a group of (cigtax and cigprice) has no effect on bwght by F-test and LM test
Hypothesis:
     H0: β4 = β5 = 0 
     H1: H0 is not true
Result: 
    F-test : p-value = 0.1999 > α=0.05
    LM test: p-value = 0.1989 > α=0.05
Therefore, we fail to reject the null hypothesis (at the 5% level)
=> the group of variables are jointly insignificant
=> dropping them from the model.
    
    
7. The right model is:
bwght = β0  + β1 faminc + β2 male + β3 cigs + u     

- The OLS regression is
bwght = 115.2277  + 0.0969faminc + 3.114male – 0.4611cigs 
        (1.2079)      (0.0292)	   (1.0764)	(0.0913)	    
	n = 1388,  R2 = 0.03564
